# Program that implements diffrent search algorithms

Given a problem from the client, the program is finding shortest path in a graph while calculating the cost.

Searching the shortest path by checking with a few implemented algorithms such as: A*,BFS,DFS and BestFs.
In addition, creating an empirical experiment and comparing the algorithms results.

To Compile:
````
g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread
 ````
Add the PORT number while running the program.
